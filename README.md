## Notes
This website is currently deployed and functioning. However, the code is a bit ugly because I was in a hurry and working on a major project at work when I put this together. Also I've learned a lot since then. I will be using the do-over branch to attempt to refactor it into something more robust and professional. Feel free to contribute by forking the project.
